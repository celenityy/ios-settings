# Additional Recommendations:

* I would recommend using [Brave](https://apps.apple.com/app/brave-private-web-browser-vpn/id1052879175) as your browser of choice. *(See recommended settings [here](https://codeberg.org/celenity/better-brave-ios))*.

* Use a content blocking extension like [AdGuard](https://apps.apple.com/app/adguard-for-safari/id1440147259) if you use Safari. *(See recommended settings [here](https://codeberg.org/celenity/adguard-safari-settings-ios))*

* Use a private, secure, & reputable DNS provider of your choice. I would recommend setting up your own [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/) configuration if you are able to (See my recommendations for NextDNS [here](https://codeberg.org/celenity/nextdns-settings)), otherwise I would recommend [Quad9](https://quad9.net/).

* Use a (reputable) VPN. I would recommend either [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/) or [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/).
